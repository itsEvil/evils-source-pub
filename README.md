# evils-source-server
 A ROTMG Like private server source made in C# by @itsEvil_

### State: !In development!

### Why make another source when so many exist already?
They are outdated, run poorly and just have too much garbage in them.

I want this source to be end up being **the** base source that people start new private servers from.

### Todo
Below is my features and performance lists that I aim to achieve.

### Features
- Behaviour system
- Realm system
- Market system
- Vault system
- Easily modifiable ItemData system
- Async TickLoops
- No random garbage
  
### Peformance
- Up to 200 players at 10 game tps and 20 network ticks.
